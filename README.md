# Stand With Palestine 
![SWP-Logo](https://github.com/PalestinianVoices/Stand-With-Palestine/assets/49572294/1076c7a8-effc-4617-8b32-25f9b9920fd3)

Stand-With-Palestine is an initiative (realized in the form of a website) aimed at uncovering Israeli war crimes, disinformation, and genocidal intent, while also providing resources for pro-Palestinians to support their cause and stay up-to-date with the ongoing conflict. 

**In pursuit of these goals, our mission lies in fulfilling four objectives:**

- Documenting the ongoing genocide as well as older war crimes committed by Israel—we will never forget;
- Keeping people up to date with the status of Gaza and recent news related to the conflict—we will always remember;
- Offer various avenues for people to support Palestine—we will never stop sharing;
- Open the eyes of people in the west to the reality of what's going on in Gaza while exposing Israeli propaganda to nurture more of their support towards Palestine—stand with Palestine;

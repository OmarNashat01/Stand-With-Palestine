### Crime Context
On Oct. 9, Israel imposed a siege on Gaza by cutting off water, food, electricity and fuel in response to the attack on Israel two days earlier by Hamas. The taps have run dry, trucks are no longer refilling household water tanks, and the desalination plants have largely ground to a halt for lack of electricity and fuel. Israel so far has barred the humanitarian aid convoys from bringing fuel, which is needed to power water facilities and desalination plants. The United Nations has called the situation a [**humanitarian catastrophe](https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/10/1142652)** and has warned that all of Gaza is in danger of running out of water as a result of the Israeli siege.

### The consequences:

Survival in Gaza now means not only escaping death from the thousands of Israeli airstrikes that have rained down over the past time, but also finding the basic necessities for living.

Some Gazans are **skipping multiple meals** just to ensure their children are able to eat. Others have resorted to **drinking brackish water** or mixing potable water with contaminated water. Few vehicles are on the streets these days as what little fuel is left in Gaza is mostly reserved for ambulances to ferry the dead and injured and to run hospital generators.

[According to the reports,](https://apnews.com/article/palestinian-health-care-doctor-israel-bombing-gaza-siege-hospital-63d00d907f5469c81f49c0201801c997) doctors in Gaza have been forced to operate on patients without sufficient anaesthetics, and to use **clothes for bandages**, **vinegar for antiseptic, sewing needles for surgical ones.** It has been [reported](https://time.com/6333474/israel-hamas-gaza-pregnant-women-hospital/) that doctors perform emergency C-sections without anaesthetics; according to [Al Jazeera Arabic](https://www.aljazeera.net/women/2023/10/30/%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%89-%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%B9-50-%D8%A3%D9%84%D9%81), there have also been instances of women having to **undergo [hysterectomies](https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements-and-speeches/2023/11/un-human-rights-chief-visits-rafah-border-crossing-gaza)** to save their lives

The destruction of homes and infrastructure, shortage of water, food, electricity, and fuel, as well as the threat of near-constant heavy bombardment has led to the [displacement](https://www.ochaopt.org/) of around **1.6 million Palestinians** in Gaza, many of whom are sheltering in UNRWA facilities.

According to the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/gaza-destruction-bombing-israel-aa528542), as of the 30th of December, nearly 70% of Palestinian homes have been damaged or destroyed. Hamas which [reportedly](https://www.dni.gov/nctc/ftos/hamas_fto.html) constitutes 2% or so of the population and which Israel claims to be its target, cannot be occupying more than 2% of Gazan homes. In fact, they are known to mostly occupy tunnels. It thereby follows, that the absolute vast majority of homes being bombed are innocent civilian objects which makes Israel's campaign a violation of international humanitarian law. It's nonsensical to believe that Israel actually targeted those 2% and the 68% are collateral damage. Let alone that if it did then they would have succeeded by now but instead they are still bombing. Perhaps until it soon becomes 100% of the enclave.

Numerous satellite images as shown demonstrate the scale of the damage

Notice how entire districts are being destroyed at once. Just as if Hamas was everywhere. It would of course take extremely long to document every single civilian object destroyed or damaged by Israel but many of those are documented in the blogs corresponding to other war crimes.

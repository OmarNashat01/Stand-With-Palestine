Bread is the most basic food necessary for survival. There are various reports on directly and indirectly targeted bakeries, food markets, and water reserves.

The World Food Programme [reported that](https://twitter.com/UN_News_Centre/status/1735402394303754590) half of the population in Gaza is starving and that nine of every 10 households spend an entire day without eating anything and [don’t know](https://twitter.com/RamAbdu/status/1733606859401990555) when they will get their next meal.

[According to the UN](https://www.notion.so/Destruction-of-Food-and-Water-Supplies-6b6691a0c3a74b89be2203916d737487?pvs=21), more than 96 percent of the water supply in Gaza is “unfit for human consumption” and [according to Euro-Med](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/israel-bombs-gazas-only-operating-wheat-mill-intensifying-its-war-starvation-against-palestinian-civilians-enar), 10 water wells, which are considered the only source of water in Rafah City, recently stopped pumping. The southern Khan Yunis desalination plant, meanwhile, which supplies drinking water to approximately 100,000 people, has ceased operations due to a fuel shortage. There is also a water crisis.

AlJazeera also reported on the 5th of November that Israeli fire destroyed water reservoir in northern Gaza amid dire shortage of clean drinking water.

The fact that almost no water and no bakeries were left was not sufficient for Israel, food markets had to be destroyed as well:

This is an instance of a food market in Jabalia camp [bombed on](https://twitter.com/Kuffiyateam/status/1711307901216674254) the 9th of October:

Many scholars have been murdered as a result of Israel’s bombardment. Professor Sufian Tayeh was the president of the Islamic University in Gaza and was classified in the top 2% of the best researchers in the world in 2021. He was k[illed along with his family](https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2023/12/359303/israeli-bloody-war-in-gaza-kills-prominent-scientist-sufyan-tayeh) as a result of air strikes on the Jabalia Refugee Camp on the 2nd of December.

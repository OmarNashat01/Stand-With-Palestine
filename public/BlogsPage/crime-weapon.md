### Crime Context
On October 10 and 11 ,2023, Human Rights Watch verified videos taken in Lebanon and Gaza showing multiple airbursts of artillery-fired white phosphorus over the Gaza City port.
The use of white phosphorus in Gaza, one of the most densely populated areas in the world, magnifies the risk to civilians and violates the **international humanitarian law** prohibition on putting civilians at unnecessary risk.


### Characteristics & Effects of White Phosphorus weapon:

White phosphorus is widely known by some characteristics which includes the garlic stifling smell. It can also be seen as dense white smoke. White phosphorus ignites when exposed to atmospheric oxygen and continues to burn until it is deprived of oxygen or exhausted. Its chemical reaction can create **intense heat (about 815°C/1,500°F)**, light, and smoke.

White phosphorus  leaves tremendous and incalculable side effects. Since it is  an incendiary weapon, it severely burn people and set structures, fields, and other civilian objects in the vicinity on fire. But its danger **extend beyond its power to burn** as it can seep into the bloodstream through the skin, **poisoning** the kidneys, liver, and heart and causing multiple **organ failure**. Even worse, it smolders inside the body, and **reignite** when bandages are removed; thus, it **exacerbate** wounds even after treatment.

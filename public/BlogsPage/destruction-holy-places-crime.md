Mosques are the holiest buildings for Muslims and its where they can gather to pray together five times every day. Since the beginning of Israel’s onslaught on Gaza, Israel has been extensively targeting mosques killing many of those praying inside. A [recent survey](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/03/1216200754/gaza-heritage-sites-destroyed-israel) by the Heritage for Peace group suggests that over 100 cultural landmarks have been damaged or destroyed, which mostly encompasses places of worship. 

This following are some instances of this war crime:

### Crime Context

On the 18th of Nov. 2023, [BBC reported](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67462610) that Citizens in Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza which hosts hundreds of thousands who fled northern Gaza in October received orders from the Israeli military to leave the city.

Around the same time, the [Guardian has reported](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/18/israeli-airstrikes-kill-80-in-palestinian-refugee-camp) that UN has warned that Palestinians face the “immediate possibility” of starvation, infectious diseases are spreading, and the war there is expected to intensify in coming days and that the original evacuation order did not guarantee the safety of civilians whatsoever because over three thousand people have been killed in South Gaza in the first forty day of the conflict.

A spokesman for the Norwegian Refugee Council [pointed that](https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/palestine-israel/2023/11/16/aid-groups-fear-israels-khan-younis-evacuation-order-will-endanger-millions/) the order is "simply unrealistic, let alone unlawful".  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the WHO, [described the plan](https://www.ft.com/content/b4e60c08-3d70-436f-a4d9-f7912dbb60ed?accessToken=zwAGCniOxQXwkdO05gwIPXBDb9Ok2feRLbtg7Q.MEQCIAfe_qkhk8kiaQji3Jljrt5HTcnv65lQGSM7VXXZNE0gAiAS_qp3BaB4V6S7umH6sz0bFN9xT2vVUOrmYZgzMbUHxA&sharetype=gift&token=d059cc11-dd1d-4793-97da-395c92727261) as “a recipe for disaster”.

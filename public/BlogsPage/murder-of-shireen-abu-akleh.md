### Crime Context

On May 11, 2022, ****Shireen Abu Akleh**** Palestinian American journalist for the [Al Jazeera](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Al-Jazeera) news network who was known throughout the Arab world for her 25-year coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was killed in the [West Bank](https://www.britannica.com/place/West-Bank) city of [Jenin](https://www.britannica.com/place/Jenin).
Abu Akleh was reporting from Jenin on May 11 as the IDF was conducting a raid in the town. Despite wearing protective gear and a vest that prominently displayed the word “PRESS,” she was shot in the head.

Israeli officials initially indicated that she was caught in the firefight and was killed by a Palestinian gunman. But Shatha Hanayasha an eyewitness along with another 8 eyewitnesses present told CNN that the shouting was deliberate and was done by the IDF. Independent investigations corroborated Al Jazeera’s claims that she was shot by an IDF soldier and that no Palestinian gunmen were in her vicinity. According to the testimony of Shatha Hanayasha, she insisted that the shouting was deliberate. That the IDF soldiers tried to shout her just as she was trying to help Shireen. All of which can be found in the following documentary:

Under international pressure, the IDF later backtracked and acknowledged that the bullet that killed Abu Akleh likely came from one of its soldiers, but no disciplinary actions were taken:

Abu Akleh’s funeral took place on May 13 in the eastern part of Jerusalem. It drew hundreds of mourners bearing Palestinian flags and chanting slogans of Palestinian national solidarity. Israeli police intervened to prevent the mourners from processing with her coffin on foot from a morgue in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood to the Cathedral of the Annunciation in Jerusalem’s Old City, where funeral rites were to be held[.](https://www.notion.so/Denying-a-Humanitarian-Crisis-in-Gaza-4e701d9fcbb5452ba997705f10517d91?pvs=21) In the ensuing confrontation, pallbearers briefly lost control of the coffin, the lower end of which nearly fell to the ground. Abu Akleh was laid to rest later that day in a cemetery on Mount Zion, near the burial sites of her father, mother, and maternal grandfather.

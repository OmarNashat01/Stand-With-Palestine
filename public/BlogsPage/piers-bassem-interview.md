## (1) Exposing Double Standards with Dark Humor

> In this Bassem uses dark humor to project the reality of how many human beings disgracefully think of other **purely innocent** human beings, just because they are “Palestinians”.

**Piers:**

First of all, what is your reaction to what happened on October the 7th? 

**Bassem:**

Oh, it was terrible, of course. 

I mean, we kind of get our news also secondhand because, you know, my wife's family, they live in Gaza. They have cousins and uncles there, and their house also was bombed. We haven't been able to communicate with them for the past three days. Communication is lost, so we don't know actually what is the, uh, how they're doing. 

But you know, we're used to that. I mean, it's very repetitive. We're used to them being bombed every time and moving from one place to the other. 

You know, it's just like those Palestinians, they're very dramatic. Ah, Israel killing us, but they never die. I mean, they always come back. You know, they're very difficult to kill, very difficult people to kill. I know because I'm married to one. I tried many times, couldn't kill her.

**Piers:**

I mean, there's dark humor there, and I understand why because...

**Bassem:**

No, it's not dark humor. 

I really try to get to her every time, but she uses our kids as human shields. I can never take her out.

**Piers:**

Again, I understand the humor, but to be serious, Bassem, about this tonight.

## (2) An Existential Proof for the Mentality Above

> Bassem continues using dark humor to expose how insane is a solution by [Ben Shapiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shapiro) is to counter the Oct. 7th attack.

**Bassem:**

I will be serious. 

I was watching your interview with Ben Shapiro, and I'll tell you one thing. I think that Ben Shapiro is one of the smartest people who ever walked this Earth. He's very, very smart. I follow him, and I believe everything he said. 

When he came out on your show, his solution was, and I quote, his solution for this is for Israel to annex Gaza and to kill as many sons of [ __ ] as possible to make sure that this will never happen again, and anyone who calls for a ceasefire will be a terrorist sympathizer.

So, God forbid, I don't want to be labeled as a terrorist sympathizer. I agree with Ben Shapiro. I think we should kill as many sons of [ __ ] as possible. 

So far, 3,500 people were killed, including 500 sons of [ __ ] in the bombing of the Baptist hospital. As we speak right now, one-third of those 3,500 were children. 

*So, my question to Ben Shapiro is, how many more sons of [ __ ] do we need to kill so Beno is happy because it changes from year to year.*

**Piers:**

The reason I'm interrupting is I think you're conflating different interviews with Ben Shapiro. 

He didn't use the phrase sons of [ __ ] with me. Let me play to you what he actually said on my...

**Bassem:**

Go back to your interview.

## (3) An Attempt to Counter the Particular Proof

> Piers attempts to nullify Bassem’s account of what Ben has said in his show. In reality, Ben has said that or something similar on [his own show](https://angrywhitemen.org/2023/10/09/ben-shapiro-israel-should-annex-the-gaza-strip-because-palestinians-are-incapable-of-self-governance/).

**Piers:**

He didn't. That was another interview. But let me play what he said to me here:

*“I frankly, I don't believe in proportionate response to terrorism.* 

*I believe that the way to stop terrorism is with a wildly disproportionate response. That doesn't mean in terms of targeting civilians; it means in terms of killing as many terrorists as humanly possible.*

*Allowing them to dictate the terms of engagement by hiding behind civilians in areas that they are supposedly responsible for means that the only option for Israel is to surrender to Hamas's hatred of its own citizens and its willingness to use its own children as human shields.* 

*No country worth its salt could ever do that.”*

Now, that is substantively different from what you said.


## (4) Questioning Proportionality using Neglected Chapters of History

> Bassem demonstrates that far more Palestinians have been dying amid this conflict to show that there has never been a proportionate response.

**Bassem:**

I agree with him. 

The question is, what is a proportionate response? 

Because it has been different from one year to another. 

<img src='https://i.imgur.com/f6aT9J7.png' alt='as'/>

So, if you look at this graph, for example, this is the death of Israelis and Palestinians, and it's changing from one year to year. It's like fluctuating like crypto. 

So, my question is, today, what is the going rate today for human lives? I mean, 2014 was a great year for Ben Shapiro. Eighty-eight Israelis died, and there were 2,329 Palestinians killed on the other side. That is one Israeli for 27 Palestinians. 

That is a very good exchange rate. 

What I'm saying is, what is the exchange rate for today so you guys will be happy? That's my question.

**Piers:**

Well, it's not me. I'm not on either side.

**Bassem:**

No, when I say 'you guys,' I say, like the people on the other side of that. I know that you don't think like that, Piers. You're one of the good guys. 

But let me tell you something. I can't remember what happened in 2014, and there was no music festival. But there must be something. I mean, they must do something. It is their fault (Palestinians). It has to be something. I mean, in 2018, 300 Palestinians died, who's counting, you know? 

So, the thing is, what my question is, let's find what the exchange rate for human life is today so we can expect the future death of Palestinians, and we'll be happy to it.

## (5) Citing Hamas to Justify Disproportionality

> Piers attempts to justify such disproportionality by recalling his evil was what Hamas did.

**Piers:**

My response to that would be this, Bassem. 

I thought carefully about this because I think it's very tricky for people like me to immerse ourselves into a conflict where we're not directly involved. 

I thought carefully about what I feel about this. I feel that the scale of what Hamas did on October the 7th supersedes anything else I've seen in this conflict really ever. 

The savagery, the butchery, the slaughter of 1,300 people, the shooting of babies, the kidnapping of a grandmother, and so on. So, if we can agree on that, which I think is inarguable, then the question becomes, again, about proportion. 

I don't disagree that there's been a lot of bad stuff on both sides going back historically for decades. But if we agree that this was on a different level altogether, quite deliberately by Hamas... 

Let me ask you the question you raised earlier about proportion. I honestly don't know what the proportionate response is. 

Well, I would ask you, if you were Israel and that had happened to you, what would you think would be the appropriate way for the country to respond?

**Bassem:**

I would do exactly like Israel did. 

Kill as many people as possible since the word is letting me do it. 

I mean, I can do it because I can, you know. But the thing is, you know what? I agree with you, and you know what? I'm going to be even ahead of you because I see the question coming. “Do you condemn Hamas for the atrocities?” Yes, I condemn Hamas. I condemn Hamas. I condemn Hamas. Hamas is the source of all evil. They are the reason for everything. And you know what? Let's, for a minute, imagine a world without Hamas right now. 

What would this world look like? Let's give this world a name, and let's name this world the West Bank.

## (6) Disproportionality Exists Even when Hamas Does Not

> Bassem counters by showing that even in places where Hamas does not exist (the west bank), disproportionality corresponding to mass killing of innocent Palestinians exists.

Hamas has absolutely no control in the West Bank, and since the beginning of this through August, 37 Palestinian kids were killed; no music festival, no paragliding, no Hamas. 

Since the occupation of the West Bank, 7,000 Palestinians were killed; no music festival, no paragliding, no Hamas. 

I can go on and on and on.

**Piers:**

No, but you don't need to because, in a way, you're preaching to the choir. 

I have followed this crisis since…, and what you're saying has validity, of course.

**Bassem:**

Piers, I am at a disadvantage here. I can hear you, I cannot see you. I am in a claustrophobic room, so please cut me some slack and don't interrupt me and interrupt my points. 

This has to be fair because if you want to only hear your opinion, I can just condemn Hamas and go home. I can do that. So, do you want to do that, or do you want to have a much more nuanced conversation?

**Piers:**

No, absolutely I want a nuanced conversation. I wasn't aware I was interrupting you.

## (7) The Irony of Warnings and Human Shields

> Bassem reveals how ironic it is to justify the killing of innocent beings by stating that they are warned beforehand or used as a shield.

**Bassem:**

Amazing, I would say I really applaud Israel for doing one thing that no military force in the word does because I heard Ben Shapiro and I heard Ron DeSantis, and they said Israel is the only military force in the world that warns civilians before bombing them. 

I mean how [ __ ] cute that is. So nice of them, because with this logic if Russian troops started warning Ukrainians before bombing their houses, we're cool with Putin, right? I mean, okay, Habibi, you have warned them, go invade, it's fine, you have done your job.

I also heard Ben Shapiro talking about human shields. So you remember my wife's family, they live in Gaza, so I asked them. I told them when Israel gives you the nice warning, the cute warning, does Hamas force you to stay in your home so you can be bombed and use you as a human shield? 

You know what Hassen, he is my wife's cousin, he's a loser, you know. He told me, when I asked him, does that happen, he told me no. The lying son of a [ __ ] lied to me. 

I told him, you don't understand Ben Shapiro and Ron DeSantis keep saying that Israel warns you and Hamas asks you to stay put. So, I told you he's a loser. He never kept a job, he even failed in all of the interviews to become a human shield.

I would believe Ben Shapiro if we agree the 14,000 casualties, I mean who's counting, are human shields. Does that mean that every single one of those civilians was standing obscuring a military target behind them? Because that's a lot of weapons. I mean Hamas is packing..

**Piers:**

No, of course it doesn't.

**Bassem:**

so there is some collateral damage, lots of collateral damage.

**Piers:**

Yes

**Bassem:**

it's fine, yeah, you kill some to save some and then kill some more, yeah, I agree.

## (8) Proving that Disproportionate Responses Do Not Work

> Bassem uses history again to show that Israel has been using “disproportionate responses” for years and they have never solved the problem.

**Piers:**

Let me ask you this again, it comes back to proportionate response. 

When the world decided it had to get rid of ISIS because of the appalling butchery they were carrying out, it did so by also killing very sadly a lot of civilians along the way by doing airstrikes against places where killing civilians is inevitable. 

Once Israel has decided that they want to get rid of Hamas and Hamas is embedded with the civilian population, I'm very concerned about what's going to happen next. 

I've written a column tonight saying I remember the Iraq, which I opposed, right. 

What would be, what would you think would be a proportional response by Israel to what happened?

**Bassem:**

Well, these are years of disproportionate responses. 

If Israel did it solve the solution, did it solve the problem, did it work before, so it will work this time? What will be the surprise this time? What will be the twist that will make this work this time? What will be different this time, seriously? 

I mean, like this is only the last 15 years. I mean because it's too many papers, I just got this. But what, how will this will be different? And the thing is, I am so glad in the introduction that you mentioned the Iraq War. I applaud you, Piers, for saying that because you were honest about it. 

## (9) Lies have Deadly Consequences

> Bassem demonstrates how false media can further cause the loss of more innocent lives. He uses the Illinois man who killed a Muslim child after hearing about Hamas and beheaded babies.

You said that spreading lies like weapons of mass destruction make people look at those people as less of humans and they would accept the death of a million Iraqi, whether by sanctions or by invasion, right? 

You are a good man; this is amazing. And you know what is similar? It's when you spread the lies of 40 decapitated babies, although it was refuted. 

So what happened happens when people hear that, you know killing babies is horrible, but when you say decapitated 40 babies, you are planting a certain image trigger in people's mind.

**Piers:**

Who has said that? Who has said that 40 decapitated babies?

**Bassem:**

You have, you have repeated.

**Piers:**

No, I haven't, I have never said that.

**Bassem:**

You haven't said on your show? 40 decapitated babies?

**Piers:**

Never.

**Bassem:**

Ben Shapiro didn't say it? Ron DeSantis didn't say it? Nobody has said that?

**Piers:**

Nobody said it.

**Bassem:**

No? Oh, okay, maybe I am wrong. Decapitated here, well, you're wrong. The same thing is happening in Iraq. 

Ben Shapiro once tweeted, not even about Gaza, about the West Bank when Israel continued to build the illegal settlements, he said (in 2017) *Israel likes to build things, and Arabs, not Palestine, not Hamas, Arabs like to bomb crap and live in open sewage*.

The Israel defense minister, he said those are human animals, and the thing is, Ben Shapiro should know better because you know, long before the Holocaust, before Jewish people were thrown in the gas chambers, the Nazi propaganda called them rats. Now as a human being, I will never accept that another human being thrown into a gas chamber, but a rat, kill at a 10, kill at a 1000, kill at a 3,500, they are sons of [__], they are human animals who live in open sewage. 

Because of that propaganda (decapitated babies), Mr. Morgan, that guy in Illinois, the 71-year-old guy, he killed, stabbing the six-year-old Palestinian kid 26 times, and he used to play with him, they used to be friends, but he went in marching into their apartment, stabbing his mother and killing him, shouting all Muslims should die. 

It took you 8 years to change one word from Jewish to Muslim and then you transferred your guilt to us and took away our land. That deal sucks, man.

## (10) Israelian Oppression and Western Support is the Root Problem

> Bassem reiterates that the root problem is long-term Israelian oppression; it can be viewed as why it’s natural for Palestinians to sympathize with Hamas.

**Piers:**

Let me ask you a question. How do we get from where we are now to peace?

**Bassem:**

Well, first of all, you need to change the perception. Nikki Haley, the American presidential candidate, said we are in Israel in this because it's a fight between good and evil. 

Now if you already decided someone is good, he can do no evil, and if you decided that someone is evil, it's good to kill them. Killing them is good. You see, it is not like something new.

I mean, I look at history, and I see, I'm sorry to say, and I'm sorry to say this, but westerners have always dealt like this with indigenous people. You first treated them like savages, you know, Native Americans First Nation Aboriginal: 'They're savages, kill all the savages.' And then when they're almost extinct, you start feeling sorry for them, you know, like animals.

So maybe the solution is that we kill as many Palestinians as possible, so the few of them that remain do not bother you. And maybe for another years, become a tree hugger and...

**Piers:**

Let me just challenge you on this. You keep talking about westerners like me, okay? So let me return the favor. 

Okay, Hamas is dedicated to the complete eradication of Jewish people.

**Bassem:**

I am not the spokesman for Hamas. I [__**] hate them. [__**] Hamas. Are you happy?

**Piers:**

You're missing my point. You're talking in a generalized way about people in the west who always talk about Arabs as savages. 

I don't. 

I actually led the media campaign in this country against the Iraq War, okay? So I don't see people in the Middle East as savages.

**Bassem:**

I am not talking about you. You're great. We love you.

**Piers:**

No, no, it's not about me. 

It's about the way Hamas behaved on October 7th. It was like savages, like a pack of savages. It was the worst atrocity against Jewish people since the Holocaust. There has to be a response. 

And my question for you, notwithstanding the history, Bassem, what is the proportionate response?

**Bassem:**

I don't know, but there's no Hamas in the West Bank, and they're still dying there. 

So what's your excuse?

**Piers:**

I don't have any excuse.

**Bassem:**

Okay, what's your explanation?

**Piers:**

I don't make any pretense that this hasn't been a massive problem between Palestine and Israel going back to the mid-40s. 

We all know this, right?

**Bassem:**

Piers, Piers, listen. I'm not saying that you're making excuses, but if you are adopting a certain point of view, you have to at least defend it. 

I'm telling you there is no Hamas in the West Bank. What is the excuse, not your excuse, what is the excuse to kill those people?

**Piers:**

Well, listen, this question of proportionality is one that...

**Bassem:**

No, answer my question. I've been answering your questions; you answer mine.

**Piers:**

It's actually not my job to answer your questions. It's not. 

I'm more interested in you, who has family in Gaza, who's an Egyptian in the Middle East, right?

I'm more interested in what you have to say.

**Bassem:**

Okay, I'm telling you, I think Hamas is the problem. 

Okay, now let's say Hamas is removed. Let's say Hamas... Yeah, I'm agreeing with everything about you want me to condemn Hamas, I will condemn Hamas, Homos, Hassan, everybody.

So let's say, for example, Hamas ceased to exist today. 

Right now, in Palestine, in the West Bank and Gaza, 20% of Palestinians go through the Israeli prison system, whether imprisonment, interrogation, or torture. 

The rest of them live a life of daily loss of land, homes, and life, and they are suffocated by this. 

So let me ask you something: 

If you are a Palestinian living in these conditions for decades, would you sympathize with your oppressor or sympathize with the people who claim they resist them, even if they are terrorists?

**Piers:**

I have made no secret that I think the conditions Palestinians have had to exist under are completely unacceptable. I've said that for years. 

So the question then becomes, how do you forge peace between two warring parts of that region who, for decades, have approached peace, in my view, with mutual sledgehammers, with no actual desire to have peace? 

I think it comes down, in the end, to great leadership. And I don't think there's great leadership on either side. Where is the Nelson Mandela figure here?

**Bassem:**

Nelson Mandela? Nelson Mandela actually criticized Israel for being a horrible state. All of the South African activists have actually...

**Piers:**

My point is how he responded to a country that was so divided is a template for how you get to peace, isn't it?


## (11) An Analogy with ISIS

> Bassem attempts to make an analogy between ISIS and Israel.

**Bassem:**

I haven't met Nelson Mandela, so I wouldn't know. But there is a very important point here. 

I want to understand what is the logic of Israel carpet bombing Gaza? I mean, if there's a logic, if this will make Israel safe, I want to hear the logic. So if they continue bombing, what are they hoping to achieve?

**Piers:**

We know what their stated aim is. 

Their stated aim is to eradicate and wipe out Hamas. 

They believe Hamas are living predominantly in Northern Gaza. They are also aware they're living amongst civilians, so it's an incredibly difficult thing, as I said, very difficult to see how they do this without massive collateral damage.

**Bassem:**

So if I can understand this correctly, basically, Israel is doing this to pressure the Palestinian community in Gaza to turn against Hamas, is that right?

**Piers:**

I'm sure that's part of it. Yes, that's part of it.

**Bassem:**

So this is exactly what terrorist organizations do because terrorist organizations have no chance of beating a whole nation in battle. 

So they terrorize and kill the civilians to spread fear and terror so they can turn against their government, change their policy, or resign. 

You have just compared Israel with ISIS.

**Piers:**

No, I haven't. I don't see any comparison between...

**Bassem:**

It's going to be the headlines tomorrow, “Piers Morgan....”

**Piers:**
The comparison, which is more suitable, is ISIS and Hamas. 

They are both nihilistic terrorist groups intent on killing as many Jewish people and others as they can possibly kill, and you can't get to peace with people like that.

## (12) Israeli Citizen Perspective

> Bassem exposes that another root problem in this issue is the current Israelian governance.

**Bassem:**

Absolutely, you know what? 

I'm going to do something that nobody's done on your television. You know what I'm going to do on your episode? I'm going to pretend that I'm an Israeli citizen. 

I'm going to put myself in the place of an Israeli settler in Kibbutz, and I want to speak to my Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. 

Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, I have voted for you because you have promised us peace, prosperity, and security. 

On the 7th of October, those sons of [__] from Hamas went into our defense. That is regularly heavily guarded. Usually, if there's like a dove that comes close to it, it will be shot. Those people went in, and they went for 6 hours before IDF forces were deployed, killing our friends, our families, kidnapping our grandmothers and babies, and went in.

I want to ask you, Mr. Prime Minister, after you have fractured the Israeli community and you have [__] our courts, our Supreme Courts, what are you doing with the money being given to you by the United States? 

Also, you are carpet bombing Gaza with absolutely no regard for our hostages, our people. 

I heard a rumor in the Kibbutz that you're doing that as an excuse to carpet bomb Gaza, so you push them into Sinai, and I didn't believe that. I like not my Prime Minister; he can never do that. 

And then I watched an interview with Danny Ayalon. He was your Chief advisor; he was also the Israeli ambassador to the United States. You know what he said, Mr. Prime Minister? 

He said that the solution for those Palestinians is to go into a vast land of Sinai and live in 10 cities 'temporarily,' huh, temporary wink wink until we build Gaza again and then we invite you back.

[__] We've seen this movie before. 

So when I saw this, I couldn't explain to my fellows in the Kibbutz how come our Israeli government is trading human lives for another piece of land. 

## (13) American Citizen Perspective

> Bassem criticizes the U.S. unreasonable support for Israel

So as an Israeli citizen, I need to hold my Israeli government accountable, and as an American citizen, I want to know all of this money that we are giving to Israel. 

We are giving them $4 billion every year. 

Joe Biden said it's the best investment America ever made. 

Well, if I am in the place of Joe Biden, I would go down and whisper in the ears of Netanyahu and tell him, 'I hate bad investments; they haunt me,' you know, like Littlefinger in Game of Thrones.

## (14) A Hidden Perspective on Israel

> Bassem compares what he believes Israel really is to what it portrays itself to be.

But the thing is, Israel always victimizes itself, and I have never seen a victim putting their oppressor under siege 24/7. 

Israel wants you to believe that they are the victim. 

Dealing with Israel is so difficult; it's like being in a relationship with a narcissistic psychopath. He [__] you up, and then he makes you think it's your fault. 

You look at Israel as Superman, but they're really Homelander. They are like they are shooting, and they are annoyed with the splashes...

**Piers:**

Bassem, I want to say two things. One, if you could just slightly mind your language. We are uncensored, but if you keep swearing, we have to apologize to viewers who may be offended by that.

**Bassem:**

I apologize.

**Piers:**

I understand the passion behind that, so let's not get too bogged down about the…

**Bassem:**

I apologize to the viewers. I apologize to the viewers for my language and the sight of dead civilians.


## (15) Can Disregard Moral Equivalency

> Jeremy, Ben Shapiro’s friend, attempts to respond to Bassem by stating that it’s indecent to talk about moral equivalency (i.e., compare death counts) and that it can be justified due the 7 Oct. attack and that this is a “war”.

**Piers:**

We have the managing director of The Daily Wire, which is Ben Shapiro's company. 

We were going to interview him on his own, but he's happy to come on and talk with you directly if you are prepared to stay.

**Bassem:**

Well, of course, I am in a disadvantage, and I would like to have my space to respond. 

**Piers:**

Okay, we'll come back after the break.

Welcome back to Uncensored. For more on the situation in Israel, I'm joined now by the CEO and co-founder of The Daily Wire, Ben Shapiro's partner, Jeremy Boring.

Jeremy, thank you very much indeed for joining me. 

I'm sorry we demoted you earlier to M.D. You are the CEO and Co-founder. 

You know Ben Shapiro better than anyone, really. 

I did a big interview with Ben obviously the other night, which went around the world and has sparked a big reaction, including from our guest Bassem Yousef, who's still with us.

First of all, you've been listening to Bassem and what he's been saying. What's your response?

**Jeremy:**

Well, first of all, I make it a point not to speak for Ben Shapiro. 

He's got 20 IQ points on me and speaks for a living professionally, so he's much better prepared to defend himself. 

But as his business partner, as his best friend, I do feel like I have to respond to the things that Bassem was just saying. 

First of all, the question of how many sons of [__] have to be killed in order to end this conflict. I suppose that the answer is as many of them as it takes. 

That doesn't mean that I or Ben or any decent person in their right mind is happy with the killing of civilians. 

I posted at the very beginning of this conflict that a woman or a child blown apart in Gaza is just as tragic as a Jewish baby killed in one of the settlements. 

That doesn't mean that Israel's actions and the actions of Hamas are morally equivalent. The tragedy is the tragedy, but the moral equivalency is nonsense. If you entered Israel with the express purpose of targeting and murdering civilians with your own hands and cold blood, that is not comparable to Israel bombing targets in the Gaza Strip and killing civilians as a terrible tragic consequence. 

War is terrible, war is an awful thing. That's why decent people don't lightly engage in war, and why Hamas should not have incited this war.

You know we can talk about the history of the Israeli conflict. I'm not a professional political commentator. I'm a CEO, I'm a screenwriter, and I'm certainly not Ben Shapiro. 

I'm not here to discuss the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but we all saw what happened on October 7th. And the idea that Israel was not going to react severely to that, or that Israel should not react severely to that, is ludicrous. 

Should be a moderating voice that Ben Shapiro should be saying, 'No, Israel should not respond in this situation.' That's nonsense.

## (16) It’s a War; It’s Normal

> Jeremy, Ben Shapiro’s friend, continues by stating that a proportionate response would be for Israel to repeat what Hamas did to Palestine which no one would want and that this is similar to how the U.S. countered the terrorists of 9/11.

**Piers:**

Let me ask you, though, Jeremy, what I mean the question, which I think is the big question: 

what is a proportionate response to that outrage on October 7th? which is the worst attack on Jewish people since the Holocaust. 

What is proportionate? 

If it's true, as reports are suggesting tonight, that there may have been a hospital hit by an Israeli strike, and up to 500 people or more have died, that would seem to me, if that is verified, and it's not verified yet, we don't know exactly what has happened other than there's been a hit on this hospital, but if that is verified to have been an Israeli strike, that will strike many people as disproportionate.

**Jeremy:**

Certainly. Well, first of all, I don't know what a proportionate response is or why we would want it.

I suppose a proportionate response would be for 3,000 Israelis to go through the fence, gun down innocent Palestinian women and children, burn their bodies, burn them alive, take hostages, rape their women. 

No one wants a proportionate response. No moral person could possibly call for a proportionate response. The purpose of war is to defeat your enemy. 

The West has, in my lifetime, forgotten the purpose of war because the true cost of war is so terrible. The last time the West engaged in war and won it was World War II, and they did it through incredible brutality. 

They did it by bringing their enemies to heel. That is not a thing to rah rah about. That's not a thing to look forward to. As I said, all decent people should avoid war, but 

I think the sort of lie of the post-World War II, the post-war consensus lie, is that somehow war in which you kill a bunch of people and don't secure victory is morally superior to war where you do secure victory. 

I would say that the only way to morally justify a war is to win it; otherwise, your very argument that brought you into the war—this enemy must be defeated. Ends up being proven a lie. 

I mean Afghanistan, I think America had every right to go into Afghanistan. 

The Taliban was harboring Osama Bin Laden, and al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda flew planes into buildings in the United States, killed thousands of our citizens, brought the nation into untold agony, pain, and horror. 

America had every right, morally, to go in and destroy the Taliban and destroy al-Qaeda. But I would argue the Taliban now rules in Afghanistan. 

The war was not won.

## (17) Attempting a Contradiction

> Piers argues that what the U.S. did to Iraq, in response of 9/11, was in fact, terrible so it would not make sense if Israel is trying to do the same.

**Piers:**

But that's my point, actually. 

I've done a column about this tonight for The Sun here in the UK, which is I was editor of a newspaper when the Iraq War happened. 

I opposed it very aggressively as the editor of the paper. Sadly, we were borne out by events.

 It was a complete disaster, the Iraq War, in my view. It was illegally contested, I think. And the consequences were appalling in terms of loss of life, a million people, in terms of ISIS being allowed to breed and create their merry hell around the world, in terms of the complete dismantlement of Iraq itself as a functioning country. 

And I think Afghanistan, again, 20 years of attacking an enemy which is now running the country again seemed to me, again, to be kind of pointless. 

And I do wonder whether Israel, in its blind fury, which I completely understand, has thought through the consequences of actually launching a full air, ground, and sea offensive into Gaza, as to what happens at the end of that.

**Jeremy:**

Well, I suppose Israel wasn't really given the opportunity to fully contemplate what the consequences of that action might be because Israel didn't instigate this war. 

This war was instigated by a horrible terrorist attack on Israel, and a state is put in a position where it has to respond. 

Now, one might argue that the very fact that Israel has yet to actually launch their ground invasion means that they are actually making a calculation about what the cost will be, what victory looks like. 

Any rational person, any decent person, can engage in a conversation about what is the appropriate response for Israel, of course they can. 

But this sort of moral equivalency thing, I don't think is a sign of decency to engage in a conversation about moral equivalency.

**Piers:**

Okay, let me bring Bassim back in. 

You've been listening to this, Bassim. What's your response to what Jeremy's been saying?

**Bassem:**

I'm sorry; I didn't catch the gentleman's name.

**Piers:**

It's Jeremy Boring. 

He's the chief executive of The Daily Wire, co-founder with Ben Shapiro of The Daily Wire.

**Bassem:**

Hi, Jeremy. 

Please say hello to Ben Shapiro and please tell him that I do think he is the smartest person to ever walk the earth. Thank you so much. 

So, in response to Jeremy, I agree with everything you said. I mean, what is disproportionate? I mean, he just used the examples from the Second World War and America, showing that civilian casualties are... 

I heard his voice; he was very sad, and as he was telling us, it is so inevitable to kill so many civilians because it's something that we cannot avoid. I hear the sadness in his voice, and I know that it's a very difficult decision to kill all of these civilians because that's for a higher cause, and I understand.

But my question, I have two questions. 

The question is, how can you justify the killing in the West Bank, where Hamas does not exist? 

And if the disproportionate response during all of these years have actually worked, what will be new this time that did not happen before? 

I just want to... that was my question, that was my question.

Can I say something on my side, a little bit personal?

**Piers:**

With respect, Bassim, with respect, I gave you half the show to have your side; Jeremy's had a lot less time. 

I'm going to have to let you go because I've been on there with you for 40 minutes.

**Bassem:**

Okay, bye.

**Piers:**

But listen, I'd like to talk to you again, and thank you for joining the program.

## (18) A Final Reminder of Evil History

> Bassem finishes of by reminding everyone of what Israel is doing to Palestine now and what it has been doing for a long time.

I appreciate it. 

By the way, my wife's family is all right, and they send us a house. It's bombed, it's beautiful. It's going to be a good Halloween theme.

**Piers:**

Well, I'm very sorry for what your family is going through in Gaza, and I mean that very...

**Bassem:**

By the way, I don't know him. I haven't actually met them. 

They didn't even come to my wedding. 

They couldn't because they are stuck in Gaza, and she never saw them because Gaza is not a destination; we hear their voices, and they die. It's fine, it's fine.

**Piers:**

Bassem, I wish your family all the very best. 

Thank you for joining me; I appreciate it.

**Bassem:**

Ah, I don't thank you.

      "At 8:43 AM, the Israeli foreign ministry responded via Twitter, asserting that Palestinian terrorists, in the act of indiscriminate firing, were likely responsible for hitting Shireen Abu Aqla. The ministry provided a video featuring a Palestinian fighter claiming an injury to a soldier and the ministry then asserted that no IDF soldier was harmed in Jenin. This claim raises skepticism due to Shireen's clearly identifiable press vest—which will be noticeable to the Palestinian fighters—and the absence of evidence supporting the assertion that no IDF soldier was injured.
